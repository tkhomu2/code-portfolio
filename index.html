    <h1>Taha Khomusi's Creative Coding Portfolio </h1>
    <h2> About me </h2>

    <p class="statement">Hello! My name is Taha Khomusi. I am a Senior at the University of Illinois at Chicago. I am studying computer science. I was born in Chicago, but I grew up in Naperville Illinois. Some of my hobbies are running, reading, and coding. I ran track throughout high school. I was a mid-distance/hurdler, and my favorite events were the 300 hurdles and the 400-meter dash. I love reading fiction. I am currently reading the hitchhikerâ€™s guild to the galaxy series. I have a bunch of passion projects that I am working on but currently I am working on building a home automation stack.</p>

    <h2>Artist Statement</h2>

    <p class="statement">I am a beginner artist who is just being introduced to creative coding. I have always been interested in art. From a young age I have played the piano, and the Cello. I have taken a few traditional art classes at UIC, but I have never really enjoyed the grind required for drawing and painting. Creative coding filled this gap for me. Using my already developed coding skills to create artistic creations has been my bread and butter. I am interested in creative coding because, I have always wanted a creative outlet that allowed my express myself without the limitations of what my hands can do. I found creative coding to be the perfect platform for me. I hope you enjoy my artwork!</p>
